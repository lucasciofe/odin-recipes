            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>300g or 312g jar good-quality lemon curd.</li>
                <li>zest 1 lemon.</li>
                <li>300ml pot whipping or double cream.</li>
                <li>25g lemon shortbread or crunchy lemon.</li>
                
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Step 1</li>
                <p>Put two-thirds of the lemon curd into a large bowl with the 
                    zest and cream, then beat with an electric whisk until it 
                    just holds its shape. Dribble over the rest of the lemon 
                    curd and divide between 6 small glass pots or glasses, 
                    marbling the curd through as you go. Sit the pots on a 
                    small tray, cover the whole lot with cling film and freeze 
                    for 30-40 minutes.</p>
                <li>Step 2</li>
                <p> Put the biscuits in a strong plastic bag and bash with the 
                    end of a rolling pin to crumbs. When youâ€™re ready for 
                    pudding, remove the pots from the freezer (they should 
                    be ice cold but still soft and creamy), top with crumbs 
                    and serve.
